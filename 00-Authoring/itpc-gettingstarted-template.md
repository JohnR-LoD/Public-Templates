# Getting Started with xxx

>This hands-on lab has been designed to help you acquire and verify the baseline skills and knowledge you need to successfully complete the [YourChallengeSeriesName] IT Pro challenge series.

===
# Introduction

>- First, you will xxx. Next, you will xxx. Finally, you will xxx.
>- First, you will xxx, and then you will xxx. Next, you will xxx, and then you will xxx. Finally, you will xxx, and then you will xxx.  

If appropriate, write a second paragraph that describes any key features of the technology that is featured in the lab.

### Understand your environment
Provide a brief summary of the virtual machines or the online services that will be used in the lab. 

In this lab, you will use an Azure virtual machine named LabVM that is provisioned for your use in the lab. 

In this lab, you will use a Windows Server 2016 domain controller named DC01, and a Windows Server 2019 server named SVR01.

===

# Task heading

Abstract. Each task must have a one sentence abstract that summarized what users will do in the task. Use the following format:
In this task, you will xxx, and then you will xxx.

1. [] Write steps by using a where / what / why format. 

    >[!knowledge] If users needs to move to a different part of the screen, tell them *where* they need to start. This part of the structure is optional. If the reason for the action is not obvious, tell users *why* they are performing the action.

# Exercise heading
If you have a group of related tasks, you may want to group them into an exercise. Provide an exercise heading that reflects the overall goal of all the related tasks, and then write an abstract.

In this exercise, you will [state the overall goal of the exercise]. First, you will [state the outcome of the first task]. Next, you will [state the outcome of the second task]. Finally, you will [state the outcome of the third task], and then you will [state the outcome of the fourth task, as appropriate].

## Task heading

In this task, you will [state what users will do in this task].

1. [] Note the use of heading two in this heading. Because it is placed on the same page as the exercise heading and abstract, you will use the heading two format instead of the heading one format.

1. [ ] xxx

    >[!note] When using notes, tips, alerts, knowledge blocks, and images, indent the item four spaces - or press Tab once. This will preserve the auto numbering in the task.
